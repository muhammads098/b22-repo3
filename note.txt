Few things happend :
1. it automatically created new remote repo under your github.com account.
2.Made the connection with your local git repo.
3.Added all the commits to your remote repo.


Now our work will continue locally

1. add a new file called note.txt
2. commited the changes to local repo.
3.we want this change to reflected in remote repository so we pushed local commits to remote repository using push origin button.
4. observe it has been added in your repoository under github.com
